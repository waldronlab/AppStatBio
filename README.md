## Summary

This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical statistical and data analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput biological data, with applications focused on single-cell sequencing.  The course assumes some familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to design experiments and analyze high-dimensional data generated by genomic technologies, including: exploratory data analysis, linear modeling, analysis of categorical variables, principal components analysis and other dimension reduction methods, multiple hypothesis testing, and batch effects.

## Textbooks

* Primary: [Biomedical Data Science](https://genomicsclass.github.io/book/) by Irizarry and Love ([ePub version](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences/) on Leanpub)
    + [Source repository](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs)
* Secondary: [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/) by Holmes and Huber
* Lab materials: [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) (OSCA) by Amezquita, Lun, Hicks, Gottardo, Oâ€™Callaghan

## Labs

Each day will include a hands-on lab session from [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/), that students should attempt in full.
