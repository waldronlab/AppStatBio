## Summary

This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical statistical and data analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput biological data, with applications focused on single-cell sequencing.  The course assumes some familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to design experiments and analyze high-dimensional data generated by genomic technologies, including: exploratory data analysis, linear modeling, analysis of categorical variables, principal components analysis and other dimension reduction methods, multiple hypothesis testing, and batch effects.

## Textbooks
