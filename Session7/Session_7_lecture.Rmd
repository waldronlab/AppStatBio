# Introduction to Linear Models

## Example: friction of spider legs

* Wolff & Gorb, [Radial arrangement of Janus-like setae permits friction control in spiders](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01101), *Sci. Rep.* 2013.

<center> <img src="srep01101-f4.jpg" height=600> </center>

- Are the pulling and pushing friction coefficients different?
- Are the friction coefficients different for the different leg pairs?
- Does the difference between pulling and pushing friction coefficients vary by leg pair?

## Example: friction of spider legs

```{r}
table(spider$leg,spider$type)
summary(spider)
```

## Example: friction of spider legs

```{r, fig.align='center'}
boxplot(spider$friction ~ spider$type * spider$leg,
        col=c("grey90","grey40"), las=2,
        main="Friction coefficients of different leg pairs")
```

## Example: friction of spider legs

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
boxplot(spider$friction ~ spider$type * spider$leg,
        col=c("grey90","grey40"), las=2,
        main="Friction coefficients of \n different leg pairs")
```

Notes:

- Pulling friction is higher
- Pulling (but not pushing) friction increases for further back legs (L1 -> 4)
- Variance isn't constant

</div>

## What are linear models?

- Linear models model a response variable $Y_i$ as a linear combination of predictors, plus randomly distributed noise.
- Which of the following are examples of linear models?

1. $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i$
2. $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \varepsilon_i$
3. $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 \times 2^{x_i} + \varepsilon_i$

Where: $i=1,\dots,N$

Assumption: $\varepsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

## What are linear models?

The following are examples of linear models:

1. $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i$ (simple linear regression)
2. $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \varepsilon_i$ (quadratic regression)

## Multiple linear regression model

- Linear models can have any number of predictors
- Systematic part of model:

$$
E[y|x] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p
$$

- $E[y|x]$ is the expected value of $y$ given $x$
- $y$ is the outcome, response, or dependent variable
- $x$ is the vector of predictors / independent variables 
- $x_p$ are the individual predictors or independent variables
- $\beta_p$ are the regression coefficients

## Multiple linear regression model

Random part of model:

$y_i = E[y_i|x_i] + \epsilon_i$

Assumptions of linear models: $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

* Normal distribution
* Mean zero at every value of predictors
* Constant variance at every value of predictors
* Values that are statistically independent

## Continuous predictors

* **Coding:** as-is, or may be scaled to unit variance (which results in _adjusted_ regression coefficients)
* **Interpretation for linear regression:** An increase of one unit of the predictor results in this much difference in the continuous outcome variable

## Binary predictors (2 levels)

* **Coding:** indicator or dummy variable (0-1 coding)
* **Interpretation for linear regression:** the increase or decrease in average outcome levels in the group coded “1”, compared to the reference category (“0”)
   + _e.g._ $E(y|x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ 
   + where x={ 1 if push friction, 0 if pull friction }

## Multilevel categorical predictors (ordinal or nominal)

* **Coding:** $K-1$ dummy variables for $K$-level categorical variable
* Comparisons with respect to a reference category, *e.g.* `L1`:
    * `L2`={1 if $2^{nd}$ leg pair, 0 otherwise}, 
    * `L3`={1 if $3^{nd}$ leg pair, 0 otherwise}, 
    * `L4`={1 if $4^{th}$ leg pair, 0 otherwise}.

- R re-codes factors to dummy variables automatically. 
- Dummy coding depends on whether factor is ordered or not.

# Model formulae

## Model formulae in R

[Model formulae tutorial](http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/formulae.html)

* regression functions in R such as `aov()`, `lm()`, `glm()`, and `coxph()` use a "model formula" interface.
* The formula determines the model that will be built (and tested) by the R procedure. The basic format is:

`> response variable ~ explanatory variables`

* The tilde means "is modeled by" or "is modeled as a function of." 

## Regression with a single predictor

Model formula for simple linear regression: 

`> y ~ x`

* where "x" is the explanatory (independent) variable
* "y" is the response (dependent) variable. 

## Return to the spider legs

Friction coefficient for leg type of first leg pair:

```{r, results='show'}
spider.sub <- spider[spider$leg=="L1", ]
fit <- lm(friction ~ type, data=spider.sub)
summary(fit)
```

## Regression on spider leg type

Regression coefficients for `friction ~ type` for first set of spider legs:

```{r, results="asis", echo=TRUE}
fit.table <- xtable::xtable(fit, label=NULL)
print(fit.table, type="html")
```

<p></p>
* How to interpret this table?
    * Coefficients for **(Intercept)** and **typepush**
    * Coefficients are t-distributed when assumptions are correct
    * Variance in the estimates of each coefficient can be calculated

## Interpretation of spider leg type coefficients

```{r spider_main_coef, fig.cap="Diagram of the estimated coefficients in the linear model. The green arrow indicates the Intercept term, which goes from zero to the mean of the reference group (here the 'pull' samples). The orange arrow indicates the difference between the push group and the pull group, which is negative in this example. The circles show the individual samples, jittered horizontally to avoid overplotting.",echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1) #same jitter in stripchart
stripchart(split(spider.sub$friction, spider.sub$type), 
           vertical=TRUE, pch=1, method="jitter", las=2, xlim=c(0,3), ylim=c(0,2))
coefs <- coef(fit)
a <- -0.25
lgth <- .1
library(RColorBrewer)
cols <- brewer.pal(3,"Dark2")
abline(h=0)
arrows(1+a,0,1+a,coefs[1],lwd=3,col=cols[1],length=lgth)
abline(h=coefs[1],col=cols[1])
arrows(2+a,coefs[1],2+a,coefs[1]+coefs[2],lwd=3,col=cols[2],length=lgth)
abline(h=coefs[1]+coefs[2],col=cols[2])
legend("right",names(coefs),fill=cols,cex=.75,bg="white")
```

## regression on spider leg **position**

Remember there are positions 1-4
```{r}
fit <- lm(friction ~ leg, data=spider)
```

```{r, results="asis", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
fit.table <- xtable::xtable(fit, label=NULL)
print(fit.table, type="html")
```

- Interpretation of the dummy variables legL2, legL3, legL4 ?

## Regression with multiple predictors

Additional explanatory variables can be added as follows: 

`> y ~ x + z`

Note that "+" does not have its usual meaning, which would be achieved by:

`> y ~ I(x + z)`

## Regression on spider leg **type** and **position**

Remember there are positions 1-4
```{r}
fit <- lm(friction ~ type + leg, data=spider)
```

```{r, results="asis", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
fit.table <- xtable::xtable(fit, label=NULL)
print(fit.table, type="html")
```

* this model still doesn't represent how the friction differences between different leg positions are modified by whether it is pulling or pushing

## Interaction (effect modification)

Interaction is modeled as the product of two covariates:
$$
E[y|x] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_{12} x_1*x_2
$$

## Interaction (effect modification)

## Model formulae (cont'd)

symbol  | example | meaning  
------- | ------- | --------  
+ | + x	| include this variable  
-	| - x	| delete this variable  
:	| x : z	| include the interaction  
*	| x * z	| include these variables and their interactions  
^	| (u + v + w)^3	| include these variables and all interactions up to three way
1 | -1 | intercept: delete the intercept  

## Summary: types of standard linear models

```
lm( y ~ u + v)
```
`u` and `v` factors: **ANOVA**  
`u` and `v` numeric: **multiple regression**  
one factor, one numeric: **ANCOVA**

* R does a lot for you based on your variable classes
    * be **sure** you know the classes of your variables
    * be sure all rows of your regression output make sense

# The Design Matrix

## The Design Matrix

Recall the multiple linear regression model:

$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta_p x_{pi} + \epsilon_i$

- $x_{ji}$ is the value of predictor $x_j$ for observation $i$

## The Design Matrix

Matrix notation for the multiple linear regression model:

$$
\,
\begin{pmatrix}
Y_1\\
Y_2\\
\vdots\\
Y_N
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1&x_1\\
1&x_2\\
\vdots\\
1&x_N
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\beta_0\\
\beta_1
\end{pmatrix} +
\begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon_1\\
\varepsilon_2\\
\vdots\\
\varepsilon_N
\end{pmatrix}
$$

or simply: 

$$
\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
$$

* The design matrix is $\mathbf{X}$
    * which the computer will take as a given when solving for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ by minimizing the sum of squares of residuals $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$.
    
## Choice of design matrix
    
* there are multiple possible and reasonable design matrices for a given study design
* the model formula encodes a default model matrix, e.g.:

```{r}
group <- factor( c(1, 1, 2, 2) )
model.matrix(~ group)
```

## Choice of design matrix

What if we forgot to code group as a factor?
```{r}
group <- c(1, 1, 2, 2)
model.matrix(~ group)
```

## More groups, still one variable

```{r}
group <- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,3))
model.matrix(~ group)
```

## Changing the baseline group

```{r}
group <- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,3))
group <- relevel(x=group, ref=3)
model.matrix(~ group)
```

## More than one variable

```{r}
diet <- factor(c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2))
sex <- factor(c("f","f","m","m","f","f","m","m"))
model.matrix(~ diet + sex)
```

## With an interaction term

```{r}
(X = model.matrix(~ diet + sex + diet:sex))
```

## Summary: applications of model matrices

* Major differential expression packages recognize them:
    * LIMMA (VOOM for RNA-seq)
    * DESeq2 for all kinds of count data
    * EdgeR
* Can fit coefficients **directly** to your contrast of interest
    * *e.g.*: what is the difference between push/pull friction for each spider-leg pair?

# Analysis of Variance

## Why Analysis of Variance?

* Analysis of Variance allows inference on the inclusion of a categorical variable
    * not just on individual re-coded variables (e.g. the leg pairs)

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
boxplot(spider$friction ~ spider$type * spider$leg,
        col=c("grey90","grey40"), las=2,
        main="Friction coefficients of different leg pairs")
```

$F = \frac{variability between groups}{variability within groups}$

## Compare ANOVA table to regression table

```{r, results='asis'}
print(xtable::xtable(summary(fit)), type="html")
```

```{r, results='asis'}
print(xtable::xtable(anova(fit)), type="html")
```

# Inference in high dimensions

## Inference in high dimensions

* Conceptually similar to what we have already done
* just repeated many times, e.g.:
    * is the mean expression of a gene different between two groups (t-test)
    * is the mean expression of a gene different between any of several groups (1-way ANOVA)
    * do this simple analysis thousands of times
    * *note*: for small sample sizes, some Bayesian improvements can be made (i.e. LIMMA package)

## Multiple testing

* When testing thousands of true null hypotheses with $\alpha = 0.05$, you expect a 5\% type I error rate
* What p-values are even smaller than you expect by chance from multiple testing?
* Two mainstream approaches for controlling type I error rate:

1. Family-wise error rate (*e.g.*, Bonferroni correction). 
    * Controlling FWER at 0.05 ensures that the probably of _any_ type I errors is < 0.05.
2. False Discovery Rate (*e.g.*, Benjamini-Hochberg correction)
    * Controlling FDR at 0.05 ensures that fraction of type I errors is < 0.05.
    * correction for the smallest p-value is the same as the Bonferroni correction
    * correction for larger p-values becomes less stringent

## Lab

We will continue from last week:

- **Batches in your own dataset**
    - Created an MDS plot colored by potential batch variables (for TCGA you have "plate" and "batch_number" variables)
    - Perform unsupervised clustering and produce a frequency table for batch vs. cluster
- Review the clustering methods used in your TCGA publication method, post to class Google Group
